### Project Insight

The world is in danger; it is time to call the Avengers! In this application, API calls made through Giphy.com are made to access gifs of your favorite Marvel Heroes and Villains! Either press a premade button of a hero/villain, or create your own.  

### Technologies Utilized

* **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, Javascript, BootStrap
* **Other**: APIs

### Instructions

* By clicking the "Character Buttons", the user will "summon" gifs of the character associated with the button clicked.
* By clicking the "add" button, whatever character the user has entered in the adjacent text field, will then be turned into a button!
* In the text field, the user simply has to think of a Marvel hero/villian they want to see through gifs, and enter their name!
