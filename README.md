## Assignment #6


### Instructions

* It's time to assemble your favorite Marvel Heroes and Villians! In this assignment, the user is presented with "character" buttons, a text field, and an "add" button.
* By clicking the "Character Buttons", the user will "summon" gifs of the character associated with the button clicked.
* By clicking the "add" button, whatever character the user has entered in the adjacent text field, will then be turned into a button!
* In the text field, the user simply has to think of a Marvel hero/villian they want to see through gifs, and enter their name!
